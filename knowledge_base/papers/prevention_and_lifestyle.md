## Evidence-Based Prevention Strategies

### Primary Prevention (Before Disease Onset)

**Exercise and Physical Activity**
Regular physical activity is one of the most promising approaches for Parkinson's prevention. Studies show that people who exercise regularly have a 20-30% lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease.

**Recommended Exercise Types:**
- Aerobic activities: Walking, swimming, cycling, dancing
- Strength training: Weight lifting, resistance exercises
- Balance training: Tai chi, yoga, balance exercises
- Flexibility: Stretching, yoga, mobility work
- High-intensity interval training (HIIT)
- Sports activities: Tennis, golf, hiking

**Exercise Guidelines for Prevention:**
- Minimum 150 minutes moderate aerobic activity weekly
- Or 75 minutes vigorous aerobic activity weekly
- Strength training 2+ days per week
- Balance and flexibility exercises daily
- Start slowly and gradually increase intensity
- Choose activities you enjoy for long-term adherence

**Mechanisms of Exercise Protection:**
- Increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
- Promotes neuroplasticity and neurogenesis
- Reduces inflammation and oxidative stress
- Improves dopamine function
- Enhances mitochondrial function
- Reduces alpha-synuclein aggregation

### Dietary Prevention Strategies

**Mediterranean Diet Pattern**
The Mediterranean diet has shown protective effects against Parkinson's disease in multiple studies.

**Key Components:**
- High consumption of fruits and vegetables
- Whole grains instead of refined grains
- Legumes and nuts
- Olive oil as primary fat source
- Fish and seafood 2-3 times weekly
- Limited red meat consumption
- Moderate dairy consumption
- Optional moderate wine consumption

**Specific Protective Foods:**

**Antioxidant-Rich Foods:**
