## What is Parkinson's Disease?

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement. It develops gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.

The disease occurs when neurons that produce dopamine, a critical chemical messenger in the brain, begin to die. This leads to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms that typically worsen over time. As dopamine-producing neurons continue to die, symptoms become more challenging to manage with medication.

### Key Characteristics
- Progressive neurodegenerative disorder
- Affects dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra
- Causes both motor and non-motor symptoms
- No known cure, but treatments can help manage symptoms
- Affects approximately 1% of people over age 60

## Detailed Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease

### Primary Motor Symptoms

**Tremor (Resting Tremor)**
- Usually begins in one hand or fingers
- Most noticeable when the hand is at rest
- Often described as "pill-rolling" motion
- May affect jaw, legs, or feet in later stages
- Typically decreases during voluntary movement

**Bradykinesia (Slowness of Movement)**
- Difficulty initiating movement
- Reduced automatic movements (like blinking or swinging arms)
- Tasks take longer to complete
- Movements become smaller and less precise
- May cause difficulty with fine motor skills

**Rigidity (Muscle Stiffness)**
- Increased muscle tone throughout the range of motion
- Can occur in arms, legs, neck, or trunk
- May cause pain and limit range of motion
- Often described as "cogwheel" or "lead pipe" rigidity
- Can contribute to postural problems

**Postural Instability**
- Problems with balance and coordination
- Tendency to fall backward or forward
- Difficulty recovering from being pushed or bumped
- May develop a shuffling gait
- Increased risk of falls

### Secondary Motor Symptoms

- Monotone speech
- Rapid or slurred speech
- Difficulty with articulation
- Reduced facial expression while speaking

**Writing Changes (Micrographia)**
- Handwriting becomes smaller
- Letters may become cramped together
- Difficulty maintaining consistent letter size
- Writing may start normal but get smaller
- May struggle with fine motor control

- Shuffling walk with short steps
- Reduced arm swing while walking
- Difficulty starting to walk
- Freezing episodes where feet feel stuck
- Festinating gait (accelerating steps)

### Non-Motor Symptoms

## Comprehensive Treatment Options

### Medication Management

**Levodopa (L-DOPA)**

- Often combined with carbidopa
- Most effective for motor symptoms
- May lose effectiveness over time (wearing off)
- Side effects can include dyskinesias

**Dopamine Agonists**
- Mimic the action of dopamine
- Examples: pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine
- Can be used early in disease or with levodopa
- May cause impulse control disorders
- Side effects include nausea, sleepiness
- Available in pill or patch form

**MAO-B Inhibitors**
- Slow the breakdown of dopamine
- Examples: selegiline, rasagiline, safinamide
- May provide mild symptomatic benefit
- Possible neuroprotective effects
- Generally well-tolerated
- Can be used alone or with other medications

**COMT Inhibitors**
- Extend the effectiveness of levodopa
- Examples: entacapone, tolcapone
- Reduce wearing-off symptoms
- Used in combination with levodopa
- Can cause diarrhea and liver issues (tolcapone)
- Help smooth out medication fluctuations

**Anticholinergics**
- Primarily used for tremor control
- Examples: trihexyphenidyl, benztropine
